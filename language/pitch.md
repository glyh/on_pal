# Quick Pitch
- A **functional** language with inspiration from Common Lisp, Clojure, Elixir, Ruby, Haskell
- Prioritization: Correctness > **Readability** > **Extensibility** > Performance
- **Extenable through** Zig/C
- The language is **always available** all the time, just like Smalltalk and Lisp.
