Initially I want to name this language Yu(çŽ‰), Which is the chinese of Jade. As languages in the crystal family choose their name from different kinds of jewels.

However, I don't like the prounciation of it, and it's unlikely for native English speaker to pronounce it correct. Thus I take `yula`.

That's also why the file extension of `yula` language is `yu` instead of `yl`
