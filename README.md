## NOTE: This is a vaporware.

## Quick Pitch
- A **lazy** **statically-typed** **functional** language
- Prioritization: Correctness > **Readability** > **Extensibility** > Performance > Performance Predictability
- **Extensible through** [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)/C
- The language is **always available**, just like Smalltalk and Lisp
- Type system that **doesn't get in your way**
- Parallelization for **free**
- Inspired by [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Common Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/), [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), 

## Rationale: Why yet another langauge

Although there's already tons of language on the market, there isn't really a language that is suitable for writing extensible softwares, like [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), just to name a few. Common Lisp was close but it's too old and it can't really leverage the ecosystem that C/C++ have well. And thus it is obsolete.

You can definitely argue that is not the language itself, but the architecture of your softwares that matters. Then all managed code should be written in plain old java because language doesn't matter.

## Mission

Misson of pal is really to serve the end user and the developer, and we expect those two group of people highly overlap. To make it easier for end user to become a hacker on the software they are using, we deliberately design the language to be extensible, easy to use, and developer friendly.

## When?

Well, I'm a newbie in PL-design so expect at least 5 years.
